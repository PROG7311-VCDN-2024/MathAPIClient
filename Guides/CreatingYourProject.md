### Creating your project

1. Build a new project called `MathAPI Client` in Visual Studio of type `ASP.net Core Web App`. Do not choose Docker (we will cover Docker later).
1. Since we are consuming an API, we will not need a DB context.
1. Since the client is handling authentication, we will still need the Firebase Authentication code from the MathApp.
