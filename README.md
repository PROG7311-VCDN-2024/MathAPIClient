## Building the MathAPI Client

This repo shows the building of the MathAPI Client in VS.

A starting point for this app is the [MathApp](https://github.com/PROG7311-VCDN-2024/MathApp). 
A requirement for this API Client is the [MathAPI](https://github.com/PROG7311-VCDN-2024/MathAPI).

I strongly recommend building both first, so you understand how it all fits together before you break it up :-)

This API Client covers aspects like:
* Making POST requests to the MathAPI and sending through an object for processing
* Making GET requests to get history
* Making DELETE requests to clear history

We did do an API client before - [ESP Loadshedding](https://github.com/PROG7311-VCDN-2024/ESP_FrontEnd)
